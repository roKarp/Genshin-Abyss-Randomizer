This repo contains a version of Abyss Randomizer for the game Genshin Impact. If you don't know what that is and are curious, follow this [link](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/)

## Tutorial

The randomizer works pretty simply. Once you have cloned the repo python file to your system and ran it, you'll be asked to input a number based on an element type.
These elements are:
```
1. Geo
2. Cryo
3. Pyro
4. Hydro
5. Electro
6. Dendro
7. Anemo
```

Once you have chosen the given element, you'll be choosing from a list of characters that are tied to those elements. 
For example, if you choose the "hydro" element, the given list of characters will be:
```
Barbara
Candace
Ayato
Mona
Nilou
Kokomi
Tartaglia
Xingqui
Yelan
```
After this, you type the characters name into the randomizer. 
If you want to choose another element, just type "0", which goes back to the element selection


Once you have added 9 different characters to the randomizer, you just type "0" and let the randomizer rip.
If you are not happy with the results from the randomizer, just type "0" again and it'll run the randomizer again.


## Upcoming stuff
For now this could be considered just a beta version, but it should work ok.
In the future I'll add some functions to delete characters from the chosen list and to reset the character selection from start.
