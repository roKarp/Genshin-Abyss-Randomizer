This repo contains a version of Abyss Randomizer for the game Genshin Impact. If you don't know what that is and are curious, follow this [link](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/)

## Tutorial

The randomizer works pretty simply. Once you have cloned the repo python file to your system and ran it, you'll be asked to input a number based on an element type.
These elements are:
```
1. Geo
2. Cryo
3. Pyro
4. Hydro
5. Electro
6. Dendro
7. Anemo
```
